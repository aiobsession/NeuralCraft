Set up environment to run the code:
1.	Download the ananconda environment from https://www.anaconda.com/download
2.	Download and setup vs code or jupyter notebook.
3.	If used VS code the by clicking right click select open with code in windows else open the folder.
4.	Install tensorflow library by using pip command
   
Predict class:
1.	Download the zip file from the github and extract them.
2.	If want to predict class of an image then open ‘predict class’ file and paste the path of an image at ‘image_path’ located at the second last line of the code.
3.	Run the code with python(Ensure all libraries are installed correctly especially tensorflow)

How I trained the model is displayed in Animal_classification_training_testing and the predictions of the test folder are displayed in the predictions.csv and predictions2.csv and 2 models are trained. Animal_classificaton_model.h5 where  the pre-trained model is not trained and Animal_classification_mode(2).h5 where the pre-trained model is trained.

Note: Due to unavailability of uploading large files in github folder, complete folder with training set is made available at G-Drive.
